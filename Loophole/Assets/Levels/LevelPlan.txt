1. Just walls, goal, player. Need to solve by wrapping yourself around the screen (Loop around to reach the goal)
2. 2 floors, need to navigate through holes to get to the goal (loop fall to reach the goal)
3. 3 floors, maze-y quality to it. (3 is a pandoras box, would be nice eventually) (Keep looping)
4. Introduce box, move it and be forced to watch it fall?  (Move boxes out of the way to reach your goal)
4. box, move in the SAME floor, but needing to loop around to move (Keep looping)
3. Box, Move around the floors to remove the box from the path, use rocks to move around 
4. Introduce walking on walls (Use walls to reach your goal)
5. Introduce moving the box to walk on walls strategically.



Should I introduce boxes right away? 
It would be better not to to introduce things little by little maybe
So when boxes come in, theyre already familiar with the rest.






Plan: 
Fall in first hole is unsolvable off the bat
Fall in second hole and you have 2 holes, one takes you on a wall and is the good one.

Plan:
Push box on first hole
Push box on second hole
Push box on third hole
win?
